# Clion shortcuts
Clion shortcuts configuration for mac and linux

I always try to unify shortcuts for most applications like IDE, browser, console etc. Here is a list of things that I changed in my clion configuration. You can also download this config for mac or linux from *.jar files.

Browser like options:

Close active tab
- Mac - "command +W" - 
- Linux - "ctrl + W"

Reopen closed tab
- Mac - "shift + command + T" - previously assigned to test
- Linux - "shift + ctrl + T"

Next tab
- Mac - "ctrl + Tab" - conflicting with "switcher in other"
- Linux - "ctrl + Tab" - -||-

Previous tab
- Mac - "ctrl + shift + tab" - conflicting with switcher in other
- Linux - "ctrl + shift + tab" - -||-

Other usefull changes

Cut up to line end (like in bash)
- Mac - 
- Linux - "ctrl + K"

Delete line 
- Mac - "command + ~" (conflict with "quick switching scheme")
- Linux - "ctrl + D"


Line (goto line like in eclipse)
- Mac - (default "command + L")
- Linux - "ctrl + L"

Related symbol (go between header and implementation)
- Mac - "command + ~"
- Linux - "ctrl + ~"
